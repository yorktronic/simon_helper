# Helper Script for the Simon Memory Game #

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Fun-1897-Simon-Game/dp/B00E9YWJOS" target="_blank">The Simon Memory Game</a> is a game that displays a sequence of colors which the player is supposed to remember, and then replay the full sequence by pressing a button or some other form of input. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, and the game can get pretty difficult after 15 or so levels. This script allows you to log the color of each step as you play the game, and at any time you can type "r" to replay the steps, step-by-step, or "a" to show all the steps in order. 

This is technically cheating, but if you have some device that requires you to reach a certain level to unlock a hidden feature, or desire to reach a certain level in the Simon game, and your brain is incapable of doing it or you just don't have the time, then this script is for you.
